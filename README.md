# cv-beauty-estimator
The machine learning model detects and constructs your face with MediaPipe Face Mesh and compares it to the "scientifically most beautiful" person's extracted facemesh, by using Eucladian distance calculation. You must face paralel to the camera, with no angles, to extract the real ratio of your face.
